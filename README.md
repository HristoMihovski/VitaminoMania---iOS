# VitaminoMania
The purpose of my application "VitaminoMania" is to provide the user with different types of fruits and vegetables. There is information related to them, such as what a particular fruit and vegetable is good for and what it's carbon footprint is. There will be recommended fruits and vegetables for every season(these will be the most popular and cheap fruits and vegetables)

# Who can use it
Everyone can use it. It's for children and people +7 years old, because some of the the information is hard to understand from todlers. Every person can use it so he/she can see what kind of fruits and vegetables are important for the persons metabolisum. 

# App Store
"VitaminoMania" will be avaible for use on the Apple's - App Store. It'll be free for downloading and for now there will be no in-app purchaces. In the next v2.0 beta I'm thinking for an option for in-app purchaces(for more follow me on Twitter were I anounce everything @HMihovski).
